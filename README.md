A handy (unofficial) app for the Newday generation event.


For a few years I've created an unofficial app to provide me with information at Newday, and often to try out or challenge some skills of mine. The first version was a j2me app, before the days of smart phones. Nobody but myself has ever used the app. In 2014 I didn't have much time but I decided I wanted the app to have more potential users, I also uploaded the source code to Github so other people can develop it if they wish.

## Notes for users ##
This year the app is only available as a mobile website. I've not got much information before going to Newday and it's going to be tricky for me to update the website "in the field". **It may not be that useful for you.** The app is unofficial and no warranty is given.

## Notes for developers ##
If you're not familiar with HTML, CSS, and ideally Javascript, then this section won't mean much to you. Why are you even reading the readme? My code is not labelled with a license, technically/legally you should not use or adapt this code without my explicit permission. I give no warranty to what it may or may not do.
* server - contains files to run on the server. I'm trying to avoid this is as it makes an internet connection more required.
* web - is the website-based app files.
