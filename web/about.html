	<p>This app was created by <a href="http://www.nomoregrapes.com">Gregory Marler</a> for his use at Newfrontiers Newday event. It is not officially supported or endorsed by the Newday team. Go ahead and tell them about it and how much you like it.</p>
	<p>I was a bit rushed to make the app this year due to a combination of many other commitments, and not seeing the information until very late. A change from stewarding, this year I'll be on the n:gage team. Do say hi if you spot me!</p>
	<p>You are running <strong>Version 0.5</strong></p>
